# Backstory

I first started trying to learn how to code back in late 2020 when I was first introduced into the concept of building and maintaining my own fivem server, this however was a failed attempt. After that I started just playing games normally again like warzone, fn, rocket league the normal stuff until november 2020 where I was introduced to making selfbots + discord bots. now I know what your thinking what does selfbots have to do with coding and shit, well in the so called "selfbotting community" you had to make your own you could find free ones which were generally token loggers but we move on. this is when I started learning basic python but I didn't really learn python well I kinda winged that one cause all I really learned was Discord.Py(Depracted  Now) After that I really got stuck into coding and left the community to develop for esports teams and whatnot just basic bot creation for people.

Now we move on to January 2021 where I met someone who was just as willing as me to learn, we created a business/collective branded "Elite Development" the main focus was to release discord bots and also provide a cheap hosting service for those who wanted to. We both had a decent amount of experience with python and furthered that more and more each day. skip forward 4 months when the collective died due to complication between mine and his friendship coming to an end due to me getting bored of it. I had quit learning and just went back to playing fivem and then began learning lua after I quit playing cmg to make the first ever version of LGN which is currently being released in 2022 but lets not get ahead yet, thru out the whole of the summer in 2021 and thru winter this is when I was learning more and more and by the end of 2021 I knew how to code in (Fluent Python, Semi-Fluent Lua, Basic JS, Basic Golang, Good Webdev Skills) I'd say this is the highlight of this story was from 2021 august+


# What I Wish I Had Done Different

Instead of learning PY as my first langauge I feel if I learned a more useful language like js, c# or even c++ I would have went along way I've always stuck with really basic syntax'd languages which was to me a silly idea cause it now means when I go to a more advanced language I give up due to me feeling fine with knowing lower base languages

# Why I Have Created This
I mainly created this to share to people who are trying to learn that there is up's and downs in the process and there will always be setbacks. Even if I didn't handle them well you should always keep trying as eventually you hit the nail in the head. If I was to recommend anything its if you want to learn learn. Part of my main learning process was making the most basic shit and adding to it, or taking open source projects and improving them. I know there is a massive stigma against using open source cause you can be considered a "skid" but I highly disagree with that, the whole point of open source is to let people learn and let community's improve. 


Thats all I really have to say, if you have spent the time to read this thank you.
